# steammonstergamehashjoin
Allow joining a specific room by accessing the monster game address with a hash address



How to Use:

http://steamcommunity.com/minigame/#roomcode

http://steamcommunity.com/minigame#roomcode


As soon as you access the Monster Game main screen, if the address bar has a hashcode, it'll automatically attempt to join that room by issuing the JoinGame command.


Why use it?
- Allows sending a direct link to people that have the script installed to join on a single click, instead of having to type the command and such;
- If you refresh the page, it'll automatically attempt to join again;
- If you're already in a room, it will NOT cancel the promt to confirm your join attempt.
